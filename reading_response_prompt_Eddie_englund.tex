    \begin{enumerate}
        \item I don't believe that I will enjoy this story as I prefer reading things with greater depth, character and especially adventure. However, while I do see the meaning of making fables to teach lessons I find most of the boring or they're trying to portray a picture that I already know.
        \item No, I do not. If you make the story about people most folks who read it will not be able to see the grand picture and start to morally and emotionally align with one part or another.
        \item Pig's in almost the entire world, are viewed as nasty, dirty, tainted, fat and lazy. Because of this, it's usually what we depict our enemies as. For example, saying ``You're such a pig'' usually means that either you're not keeping a location like your room clean or you're not grooming yourself enough.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The old major's evidence for believing that humans are their enemy is quite lackluster and not very thought through. He begins by calling out all the ``evils of man'' like, how they took the horses foul and the Hens eggs. The issue with this view is that he does not know the reason. He simply stated the \textit{evil's} of the owner Mr. Johnson but did not incorporate his reasoning. It also assumes that just because Mr.Johnson was ``evil'' all humans must be so as well.
        \item A world controlled by workers will not work. This has been proven many times. The issue at hand is that there as simply too many differences between people and they must be lead by someone or a group of people. The reason for this is that with too many different variables in different people will lead to different ways of execution and by controlling this with a leader-worker basis it works a lot better. The major variable with people is knowledge and personality. People with greater knowladge are usually better leaders however, they just like the workers must be kept in check so that they do not exceed their boundaries.
